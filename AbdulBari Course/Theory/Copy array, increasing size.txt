Remember size of an array cannot be increased !

There is an alternative way to increase the size of
an array by: 

int *p = new int [5]; // Need to Increase this
int *q = new int [10]; // New array created

for(int i=0; i<=10; ++i){
	q[i] = p[i];
}

p=q;
q = Null;

this is how we increase a size of an Array, by copying
from one big array to another.
