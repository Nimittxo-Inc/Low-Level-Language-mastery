Structre takes memory according to the data type defined inside It.

example: 
struct Rectangle
{
    int length; // 2 bytes
    int breadth; // 2 bytes
                              ----- Total 4 bytes
};

// How does It look inside the main fucntion:

int main(){
    struct Rectangle r;
    struct Rectangle r= {10, 5};  
}               

so this r is created inside the main frame of Stack Memory
