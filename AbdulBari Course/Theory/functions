Arrays can be passed via address, arrays cannot be passed via refrence
Arrays as Pointers:

When you pass an array to a function, what actually gets passed is the address of the first element of the array. 
This means the function receives a pointer to the array, not the entire array itself.
For example, if you have an array int arr[5]; 
and 
pass it to a function func(arr);, 
itâ€™s equivalent to passing func(&arr[0]);.
