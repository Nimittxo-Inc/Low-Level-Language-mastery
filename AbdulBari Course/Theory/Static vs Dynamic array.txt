for example we create: 

void main() 
{
    int A[5];  // Created in Stack !


Now to create a dynamic array we need to create It in
Heap!

Now to access Heap we need a Pointer

[ REMEMBER ] !!

The pointer to the array in heap is same as the name
of Stack, i.e. we can use pointer to access stack

int *p = (int*) malloc(6*sizeof(int));
p[0] = 1;
p[1] = 2;
p[2] = 3;
p[3] = 4;
